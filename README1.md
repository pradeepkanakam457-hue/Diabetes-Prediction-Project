# ü©∫ Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on several medical parameters such as number of pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and more. The model is trained using supervised machine learning algorithms.

## üìå Project Objective

To build a machine learning model that can accurately predict diabetes in patients using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset. This project is developed as part of my AI & ML Internship at YBI Foundation.
